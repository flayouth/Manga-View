# Manga-View

## About

- This application is being deployed to help store user input for manga/anime the user plans to watch. An organization tool to improve the readers expirience.


- We have a hard time keeping track of manga/anime adaptations. So, we used that as motivation to create a user centric application, built to display our knowledge of Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API, using Handlebars.js as the template engine, MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database, and [insert] for the browser side.
